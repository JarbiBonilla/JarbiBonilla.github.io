### The Big Question

Ever since I started this course and I mention it to people, they always seem to ask me, "Why Software Engineering?" 



##### First Experience

Before I even started at Flatiron, as I mentioned in my last blog, I was confused about what I wanted to do with my life and career. I had a lot of friends who were in the field of development who were always trying to push me to dabble in it, because they thought that I would enjoy it. I finally caved in and my first ever experience with coding was from a site my friend sent me called [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). It was free and I could try out different challenges, so I say, "why not?". It was basic HTML and CSS and Free Code Camp did a very good job in explaining everything! So I continued the free courses on there and I grew to enjoy coding (which is something I never even thought about doing). I love problem solving and I am very analytical in my thinking, so that aspect of coding is what I think really drew me to it. 


##### Results!

Another aspect of coding that I have grown to enjoy is the end result! Being able to see in real time the finish product of all your hard working is extremely rewarding. I love the instant satisfaction of seeing my application come to life as I build it. Even with all the frustrations and headaches that come with debugging, it makes the end result that much better! 


##### Patience

One more thing that the amazing world of coding has taught me... PATIENCE. As I mentioned above (and as most developers know), debugging is where we spend most of our time! When I first started coding, debugging and trying to figure out what is going on in my code was something I would dread. I would give up right away and just try to tackle it the next day. The more and more I tried to debug, the more I realized is that that is where I truly learn. I was always scared of tackling a problem in my code cause it would make me feel like I was not learning. Having spoke to more experienced developers, they mentioned to me that learning is something that I am always going to be doing as a developer, so I should not be afraid to dive into the unknown. 


### So Why Software Engineering?

Having said everything, whenever anyone asks me, "Why Software Engineering?" I tell them because I have finally found something I love. Sure, it can be a pain sometimes, but was isn't? Everything in life, whether it is a career or hobby, will sometimes frustrate us. The question we have to answer is, "Is this something I can see myself loving and fighting with?" and when I think about coding, I can answer that question with a yes. I chose software engineering because it brings out my greatest strengths, as well as my weaknesses, I love seeing the results of my hardwork, and because it is teaching me to be a better person. I encourage anyone who has been in my shoes of not knowing what to do, to experiment with different things! Try a ton of things out and I am sure you will find something you are passionate about, I sure glad I did.
