This is it.... The accumulation of what feels like years of hard work, frustrations, and many victories finally coming together. As I approach my final project in this course, I look back at how far I have come and I still cannot believe it. I think I have said this in every blog I have written, but it still does not feel real to me! I cannot believe that I started the pre-work in September of 2019 and here I am in August 2020 about to graduate. It is a bittersweet moment because I have thoroughly enjoyed coding every single day with people I can now call dear friends and will miss that. But it is also exciting because I am about to embark on a journey that is a career as a Software Engineer!


### My Project

My project is called On The Blog! It is a web application where anyone can log on and just blog to their heart's content! Looking back, there has been a similarity in most of my projects, so for this one, I wanted to do something that I normally never thought I would make, and a blog website was the first thing that came to mind. I love the idea of people being able to express themselves through words (I journal myself), so being able to make a website where people can do that online fascinated me!


###  Challenges Faced

I honestly think that the hardest thing for me this time around was actually coming up with an idea! I wanted to venture out of my comfort zone and create something completely different from my other applications to diversify my portfolio. Also, Javascript and I have a love/hate relationship. The more I code in JS, the more and more comfortable I feel with it, but there are still some times where it can be frustrating. I am hoping to come back to this blog fairly soon and be able to say that JS and I are only on good terms.

1. Components

One of the things I struggled with was React components. For some reason, I could not understand the concept of components and what their use in React was. And there is something that I lacked in doing when it came to learning a new language, and that was READING THE DOCUMENTATION. Which is what React forced me to do. Concerning components, the documentation put it best:

```
Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.
```

[From React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)

I think once I was able to think about them as functions in JS and see that the `props` being passed through the components where the inputs, it made it easier for me to build everything out.


### For The Future

There is a saying that goes "We are our own worst critics" and I am a firm believer in that. As I look at this project and the ones that come before it, there are things that I want to change to this one and all my other ones. Not to say that I am not proud of them (because I am), but I know there are things that I can do better in each and every single one of them. As I continue to grow as a developer, I know that I can spruce up this project, as well as all my other ones. 

I am excited to see what the future holds. As the end comes near of this bootcamp, I know that learning is something that never stops, especially in the world of development. I am extremely excited to see what the future holds. This program as a whole has made a better person in all regards. I am so thankful for Flatiron. I would not be who I am today if it was not for this program, and for that, I will be forever grateful when I look back and see how far I have come.
