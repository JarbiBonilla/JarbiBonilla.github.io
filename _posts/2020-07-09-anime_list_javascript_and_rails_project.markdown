If anyone would told me about a year ago that I would be where I am now, I would have thought they were crazy. Never did I think I would be in a Software Engineering Bootcamp, let alone this far! This has been by far one of the best decisions I have ever made. I cannot even put into words the plethora of knowledge I have learned plus coming across some amazing lead cohorts and people I have become friends with. It is all finally starting to come together for me. In but a short few weeks, I will be done with this amazing program and will be thrown out into the real world of development.


### My Project

My project is called Anime List (Similar to My Anime List)! It is a web applications where you can keep track of your favorite animes and the ones you are currently watching. You can also keep track of any of your favorite characters and talk about any awesome powers they may have. For those that have read my previous blogs and/or have checked out my other applications, you already know what a big anime fan I am. Naturally, I implemented into this project as well. My Anime List is a website I have used for years and continue to do so and being able to replicate something like that I thought would be the coolest thing!


### Challenges Faced

I know I mentioned in my previous blog, but I think this by far has been the most challenging application for me to build. I have been coding in ruby since September of last year and have been using Rails for a few months now, so breaking off from the convention that Rails needs to function was hard for me to break off from. There are some many thing in Javascript that differ from Rails that it intimidated me. 

1. THIS THIS THIS

Understanding the concept of `this` was a mind-boggling thing for me to grasp. For some reason, knowing what object `this` referred to depending on the context was really hard for me to understand. But after studying it for quite a bit (an understatement) and reviewing it with some of my lovely, fellow cohorts, this was the best way for me to explain it:

- In a method, `this` refers to the **owner object**.
- Alone, `this` refers to the **global object**.
- In a function, `this` refers to the **global object**.
- In an event, `this` refers to the **element** that received the event.


2. Rest and Spread Arguements

This too, was also very confusing for me to wrap my head around, let alone implement it into my code. I could not figure out whether to pass the `...` argument before or after the keyword in the `()`. But, long story short, the best way I could describe both of these is like this...

The **rest parameter** syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

the **spread operator** allows you to pass elements of an array into a function as an argument.

Playing around with these in repl.it and using dummy data helped me understand these quite well.



### For The Future

Javascript has taken me for a rollercoaster, and even now, it still something that I want to get really good at. It is a love/hate relationship. Now that we are learning react, there are a lot of things I can already think of implementing into this project in the future. This is definitely a project that I want to come back to. Maybe add an interactive feature to the anime cards that I am rendering on the browser. Just a thought. 

I won't lie and say there haven't been times where I have wanted to stop and just quit, because there have. But, don't get me wrong, I love coding and the satisfaction ones feels after completing a project. As many times there has been the sense of defeat, I have felt the sense of accomplishment as well. That will probably be something I will feel as long as I am in this field, but I feel like wherever you go, you will feel that. I cannot wait to see what the future holds after I graduate from Flatiron. I know that years from now, Flatiron will be one of the greatest reasons for where I will be.
