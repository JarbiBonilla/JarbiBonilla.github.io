### Where it all began

This is the first blog I am writing that does not pertain to a certain project I have made for this program. I cannot believe it has been almost a year since I start at Flatiron! I started as a part-time student in the Full Stack course before switching to full-time halfway through (which is why it took me almost a year). Every blog I have written so far has been a technical one, so I thought for this one, I would change it up a little. 


I will never forget the day when a friend told me about Flatiron. I was telling him about where I was in life concerning my future career and what I wanted to do (because I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life). So he briefly mentioned Flatiron because he knew people that were in the same spot that I was! I honestly did not think about it too much at first, but he got me in contact with one of the recruiters and he was amazing. So, I decided to do some of my own research on Flatiron and everyone that I came across and asked questions about it only had amazing things to say about it. From that point on, I decided to take a leap of faith and start the program and I am so glad I did! 


### Where I am now

Deciding to take that leap of faith and enrolling into Flatiron was seriously was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I have learned so much, have met some amazing people, and have a clearer vision of what I want to do with my life. It seriously flipped my world upside down and for the better! This course has come to an end for me and I have finally graduated. As I continue to grow as a developer and a person, Flatiron will always be one of the greatest reasons for it. I have grown not only in the world of development, but also as a person. Flatiron has taught me to be a better person. It has taught to appreciate the little victories in life, to be patient, and to overall enjoy this journey that is called life. 


### Acknowledgments

I, of course have to acknowledge so many people that have been on this journey with me! I have to thank my mother, of course, for supporting me throughout this whole course and helping me financially as I made the switch to full-time. She has been a gem in my life. My fellow cohorts as well (Raymond Gonzalez, Allison Cortez, and Pharia Le) to name a few. They have been wonderful and they knew the struggle as well as I did as we trucked through this course and I would not have gotten this far without their help. Also, my wonderful lead cohorts Corinna Brock Moore and Madeline Stark! They are two of the most wonderful people I have had the pleasure of meeting. They have been such a great help to me in the course and just with life struggles as well. I truly value them so much, thank you again for everything.
