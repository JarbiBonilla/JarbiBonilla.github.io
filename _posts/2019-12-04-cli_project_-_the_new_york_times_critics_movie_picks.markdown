Hello everyone!

My name is Jarbi Bonilla and I am in the Software Engineering Part-Time 10/07 cohort. For our first ever project, we were asked to create a CLI gem. I was very intimated at first because I was getting so used to having the tests in the labs to nudge me in the right direction. Without that, I wasn't sure where to start. Luckily, our amazing lead cohort, Madeline, gave us a ton of resources to start with!


#### **1. How my Gem works!**

I decided to use the New York Times' API for my CLI. With this API, I was able to pull the latest movies' picked by the critics' over at the New York Times', along with their reviews. Once you get you my gem up and running, you are greeted and asked if you would like to see the list of movies! At this point, you would type either "y" to see the list of movies or "n" to exit the program. From there, my gem will print out the list of movies! You have three choices from there: 1. Pick a number to get the details of a certain movie. 2. Type "list" to see the list of movies again. 3. Type "exit" to leave the program. The details for each program are the title of the movie, the name of the critic who picked the movie, the opening date of the movie, link to the movie review, and a short summary of the movie!


#### **2. Challenges I faced.**


My biggest challenges were two things: 1. WHERE TO START and 2. Finding the right API. I was so stuck on trying to figure where to start because this was the first time I ever had to do something like this. The "training wheels" were off so to speak. There were no test to base my code off of and I did not have access to Ask A Question. Again, thanks to my lead cohort and watching all the videos and reviewing example repos', I was finally able to get started. My second challenge (and probably my biggest), was finding the correct API. I think I went through 4 of them before I found the one I best was able to implement into my gem. 

#### **3. For the Future....**


As I continue through the course and continue learning, I would love to go back to add to my gem. Maybe when I come back to it, I can add another objects class and iterate over characters that are in the movie. Or maybe I could add an image or something along those lines. I definitely want to come back to it and make it more "fancy".



This is definitely one of the most challenging things I have had to do during the course so far and in general. It has been an experience.... a good one. I encountered a whirlwind of emotions. I panicked, felt anxiety and stress. More importantly, I learned a lot. Not only about coding, but about myself too. I learned that if I apply myself, I can accomplish anything! I am so grateful for the experience of this project as well as with the cohort so far. I don't think I would have been able to finish it without the help of Madeline or the amazing cohorts I have been so blessed to work with.

#### **Till next time!!!**
